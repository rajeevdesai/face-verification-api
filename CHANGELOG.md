# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Bring-your-own-model configuration on `loadModels`: `recognition` and `liveness`
  preprocessing/metric overrides (`inputSize`, `layout` NCHW/NHWC, `channelOrder`
  RGB/BGR, `mean`, `std`, plus `l2normalize`/`metric` for recognition and
  `cropScale`/`liveClassIndex`/`applySoftmax` for liveness). Models that don't match
  the bundled defaults now work without forking.
- `livenessModelPath` is now optional — omit it to disable the liveness stage
  entirely; `checkLiveness` then defaults to false.
- `euclidean` distance metric (in addition to the default cosine).

### Changed

- `CompareResult.details.cosineDistance` renamed to `details.distance` (metric-agnostic).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-01

Initial release.

### Added

- Browser-only 1:1 face verification pipeline: MediaPipe FaceLandmarker → Umeyama
  alignment → MobileFaceNet (`facex_nano`) embedding → cosine distance.
- `loadModels()` — loads and caches the landmarker, recognition, and liveness models
  as singletons, with optional warmup.
- `compareFaces(baseline, current, options?)` — returns a structured `CompareResult`
  with `match`, `confidence`, fraud `flags`, and `details`.
- Optional MiniFASNetV2 passive liveness check (reliably rejects screen/video replay; print detection imperfect).
- Configurable `threshold`, `livenessThreshold`, and `checkLiveness` options.
- `models/download.sh` for fetching the three model weights (not bundled).
- Unit tests (Umeyama math + decision/flag logic) and a browser integration suite.

### Known limitations

See [Open Risks](./README.md#open-risks). Notably: liveness rejects screen/video
replay but does not reliably catch print attacks, and the default thresholds are
uncalibrated placeholders.
